#Introduction

The following implementation is a reconstruction of the published algorithm by Stephen A. Ramsey, Bioinformatics Vol. 26, 2010 <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/>.

The following code is open source, built under R and C++ using the standard RStudio toolset including Rtools in a Windows 7 64 bit mainframe.
The used pacakges were:

- ggplot2
- Rcpp
- dplyr
- reshape2

Additional functions are provided via gitHub distribution.



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
